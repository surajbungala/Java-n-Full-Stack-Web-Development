        However, it is not impossible either.  Here are five tips that’ll help you get 
        better in front-end design and web development.</p>

        <!--Ordered Lists-->

        <ol type="1">
        
            <li><h3 class="uppercase cursive" >Commenting!</h3></li>
            <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, 
                especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. But 
                remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. 
                With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you 
                or others to jump in and understand where things are at and how they 
                work. 
            </p>

            <li><h3 class="uppercase cursive">Invest in Productive Tools</h3></li>
            <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from 
                browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices available now 
                is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web tools 
                that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like 
                Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing 
                short of a godsend for web developers.
            </p>

            <li><h3 class="uppercase cursive">Learning Command Line Is The Way To Go.</h3></li>
            <p>It is a standard convention among developers to use GUI tools to power the 
                terminal. What most of them don’t realize is that by doing so, they end up 
                spending a significant portion of their valuable time in handling GUI 
                tools than making progress on the terminal. The right way to go about 
                it is learning the command line. Start with the basics of the command 
                line and advance to higher levels as you go, and you’ll find that you can 
                complete several tasks with much more ease and efficiency with command 
                line tools than with GUI tools. Moreover, automating the terminal with
                appropriate commands is a great way to save time and energy.</p>

            <li><h3 class="uppercase cursive">Always Be Curious.</h3></li>
            <p>A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with 
                the latest news and innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive 
                stand and learn new things about front-end development from informative 
                blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful 
                learning sources for front-end developers - </p>

                <li><h3 class="uppercase cursive">Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h3></li>
                <p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering
                    with its functionality. This will improve the quality and readability 
                    quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code will 
                    continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was 
                    before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that 
                    refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from 
                    plagiarism.</p>

                <li><h3 class="uppercase cursive">Automate!</h3></li>
                <p>As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little
                    details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on 
                    things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency management, performance,
                    optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?</p>
            
                <p>Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. 
                    While automation can take care of things such as optimization, testing, 
                    etc., you can focus on the core areas of front-end development such as 
                    HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the user-experience,
                    and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you 
                    will also learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the 
                    overall functionality of your site.  Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very
                    efficient automation tools.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, 
            in the long run, you must always remember two things while designing your 
            platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create your signature 
            style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end 
            development. </p>
